# 🚗 Digital Twin of a Car Engine

This project is a **Python-based Digital Twin** that virtually replicates the behavior of a car engine.  
It simulates real-time engine parameters, performs stress testing, analyzes engine health, and predicts maintenance needs — all **without using physical sensors or hardware**.

The goal of this project is to explore the **Digital Twin concept** and understand how virtual models can mirror real-world systems for testing, diagnostics, and optimization.
